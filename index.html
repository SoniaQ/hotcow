  <h2>Why Learn HTML and CSS?</h2>
  <p>
    Everything you see on a website is a result of the combination of HTML and
    CSS. With these two languages, you will have the skills you need to bring
    your website design to life. Jumpstart that vision by using Bootstrap, a
    popular library that allows you to create beautiful, responsive pages with
    very little time and experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Take-Away Skills:</h2>
  <p>
    You’ll build four simple websites using web development fundamentals,
    including HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. You’ll learn to understand and modify
    the structure of a basic website, as well as how to change the way a page
    looks and is laid out.
